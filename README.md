# Image-Audio
**pytesseract**

PyTesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine, which is used for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, i.e., extracting text from images. It is not designed for converting images to audio.

To convert an image to audio, might need to use a different approach, such as converting the text extracted from the image to speech. Here's a general outline of how you could achieve this using Python:

**Necessary Libraries:**

1. **Text Extraction using PyTesseract:**
   - Install the required libraries:
     pytesseract
     
    **Steps to install pytesseract:**

    Certainly! To install PyTesseract as a package, can follow these steps. Please note that PyTesseract requires Tesseract-OCR to be installed on the system.

    1. **Install Tesseract-OCR:**
   - For Windows: You can download the installer from the [official Tesseract GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases).
   - For Linux (Ubuntu): Use the package manager to install Tesseract.

   2. **Install PyTesseract:**
   - Install the `pytesseract` Python wrapper using pip.

   3. **Configure the Tesseract Path (for Windows users):**
   - If you are using Windows, you need to specify the path to the Tesseract executable. You can set it in your Python script as follows:
   - Make sure to replace the path with the actual path where Tesseract is installed on your system.

   Now, after runninng the necessary code should be able to use PyTesseract in Python scripts to perform OCR on images. Here's a simple example:

2. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**
   - Install the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library:

Run the code 

 The code create an MP3 file with the speech version of the extracted text.

Please note that the quality of the generated audio might vary, and you may need to experiment with different libraries or settings based on your specific requirements.
