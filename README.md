# Image-Audio
**pytesseract**

PyTesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine, which is used for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, i.e., extracting text from images. It is not designed for converting images to audio.

To convert an image to audio, might need to use a different approach, such as converting the text extracted from the image to speech. Here's a general outline of how you could achieve this using Python:

**Necessary Libraries:**

1. **Text Extraction using PyTesseract:**
   - Install the required libraries:
     pytesseract

2. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**
   - Install the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library:

Run the code 

 The code create an MP3 file with the speech version of the extracted text.

Please note that the quality of the generated audio might vary, and you may need to experiment with different libraries or settings based on your specific requirements.
